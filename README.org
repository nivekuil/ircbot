* #ucsd ircbot
A simple IRC bot in Python 3.  Most of it was written in an hour, but the code should be fairly reusable if not robust.  Check bot.py for a list of commands.

Some commands can be inlined by prepending a colon, like so:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
<user> check out today's :,xkcd; getting the joke has temporarily staved off my crippling insecurity!
#+END_EXAMPLE
